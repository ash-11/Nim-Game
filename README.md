# Nim-Game
An impartial game developed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS where one wrong move and you will lose.

[Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing (i.e., nimming) objects from distinct heaps or piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap/pile. The goal of the game is to avoid taking the last object.

Motivation for developing this game : [Spragueâ€“Grundy theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprague%E2%80%93Grundy_theorem).
